Important: This app was designed to be used with [Lighting Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pierrox.lightning_launcher_extreme). If you don't have that launcher this will be useless.

This tool shows a resizable popup at the top of the screen when a link to a script api page is launched, for example when you long click a function in the script editor from Lightning Launcher.
That popup will show the detailed description of the function or a summary of the class.

Note: Currently you need an active internet connection.

Features:
- History. You can navigate and go back as desired.
- Up: You can go easily to the class of the current function or to all classes in the current class's package.

Planned features (not yet):
- Offline api.
- Auto closing.
- Open in browser
